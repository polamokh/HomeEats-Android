## Components Made and Used
### FireBase Dao [Github Repo](https://github.com/islammohsen/FirebaseDao)

  **Dao** stands for Data Access Object. It is a software design pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the database.

  Firebase Dao is an abstract class that allows you to interact with the Firebase database in your Android application in an easy and fast way.
You have to implement it to your own Dao class and most of the job will be done for you.

### Gmail Sender [Github Repo](https://github.com/islammohsen/GmailSender)

  **Gmail Sender** is a java class that enables developers to send gmail emails easily throughout the code.
